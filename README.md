# longhorn / codename

Hey people. This is Souradnice.
Straight to the point.

I am looking for members to my project. Having previous experience with programming is great thing, however you do not need to have.
All you need to have is a CRUSH to create an all new PC/MOBILE GAME for hungry players who did not find an ideal game yet.

I got previous experience within Java/C#/SQL/PHP. It is not so important, now i wanna dive into Unity engine and create a splendid and addictive game.

There are two basic axioms.
#1 Programming is the future
#2 Can earn a lot of $$$$$$$$$

Interested? Get in touch with me either via email daniel.kolacny@outlook.com or directly via WA: +420 724 262 545

Cheers
Souradnice
